Hi! My name is Kelly and I'm a software professional living and working in Northern Virginia. 

I enjoy working as a fullstack developer, with a preference for the frontend. 

If a genie granted me three wishes, I would wish for all code to be self-documenting and well-tested. Barring that, I would do my best to make it happen anyway. 

Feel free to say hello at kelly.m.ripple@gmail.com.
